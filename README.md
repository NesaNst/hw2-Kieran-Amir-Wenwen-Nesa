## Part 4: User Stories in Gherkin Syntax
### Alert EMS When User Falls
Given that I’m wearing the device and not exercising, when my heart rate is out of normal range for more than 1 minute, then the device will call 911.






## Part 5: System Requirements in EARS Syntax
### SOS Button
While I’m wearing the device, when I press the “SOS” button, the device will call 911. If the call is unsuccessful, it will call again. It will continue the loop until battery is out.
